This is an enrollment application that runs inside of PowerSchool
and allows users at a school to enroll students in ad hoc RTI classes
which meet once a week. Administrators can create and edit classes and 
sessions, and enroll students. Students can enroll themselves in 
classes. Classes can be copied from one session to the next and 
student enrollments can also be copied from one session to the next.
Also, students who are not enrolled can be randomly enrolled, so that
none are left unenrolled.
